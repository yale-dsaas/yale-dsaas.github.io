For Spring 2024, we will be organizing the seminar in hybrid mode. The zoom link will be sent via deptartment wide email and the in-person session will be held in the KT 5th floor conference room. While the seminar is held in virtual or hybrid mode, we ask our attendees to follow our [Guidelines for Virtual Engagement](rules/)
