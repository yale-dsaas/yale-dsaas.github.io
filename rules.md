title: Discussion Guidelines
---

This seminar aims to be a welcoming and inclusive space for all attendees. We ask that everyone be respectful towards one another and adhere to the guidelines set by the discussion leader. To ensure productive and constructive discussions, we've outlined the following guidelines:

1. **Center respect and inclusivity**: Approach every discussion with respect for diverse perspectives and experiences. Be mindful that each attendee brings unique insights to the conversation.
2. **Be mindful of different experience levels**: Attendees come with varied levels of experience and expertise in astronomy topics and data science methods, so please be considerate of this diversity.
3. **Focus on ideas, not individuals**: Critique techniques, methods, and results, not the authors themselves.
4. **Consider the venue and audience**: Ongoing or in-depth conversations may be better continued outside or after the seminar, depending on the context.
5. **Respect comfort levels**: Participation in selecting a paper does not imply comfort with presenting it. No one should feel pressured to present if they’re not comfortable.
6. **Engage actively**: Everyone is encouraged to contribute to the discussion at least once during each meeting to foster a lively and inclusive dialogue.

# Guidelines for Virtual Engagement 

Our goal for this seminar series is to highlight data science techniques and foster discussion between participants about their applicability to astronomy and astrophysics. In order to achieve an active and engaged atmosphere in our meetings, we provide these guidelines for virtual engagement during online / hybrid meetings: 

1. Act as you would in person: don’t do other work or multi-task by minimizing distractions
2. Leave your camera on
3. Attend the whole discussion (avoid arriving very late or leaving early) 
4. Unmute or use chat to engage with both the speakers and other participants: everyone should try to contribute to the discussion at every meeting

We understand that a number of hindrances can affect virtual participation (internet connection may prohibit sharing video, your environment may be noisy, other meetings may run over, unexpected distractions may arise), so these guidelines are recommendations not requirements.
