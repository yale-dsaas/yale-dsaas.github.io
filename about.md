title: Seminar Overview
---

The Yale Data Science X Astronomy & Astrophysics Seminar is a methodical seminar focused on the intersection between data-science & astronomy-astrophysics. The seminar is aimed at discussing data-science techniques/methods that are being developed/employed to deal with ever-increasing data volumes in astronomy & also allow for the exchange of ideas between the different topical silos in astronomy-astrophysics. 

The seminar meets every 2 weeks during the fall and spring semesters. During each session, there is a long-format presentation of 30-40 minutes. This presentation can be on an extended discussion of a paper; demonstration of a method/software/technique, or a talk by a visiting speaker. Besides this, members of the seminar may also use benty-fields (Look for “Yale Astro. Data Science”) to sign up for short (~10-15 minute) presentations of papers. 

Attendees are also welcome to discuss data-science-related challenges that they are facing in their work and want input from other attendees. This will be done in the latter half of each seminar besides the benty-fields discussion whenever scheduled. If you are interested in this, just give a heads up to the specific day's discussion leader. 

The organizers of the seminar solicit interest in giving long-form presentations at the beginning of every term. Based on the number of requests received and slots available, a tentative schedule is drawn up for each term. We are also happy to host speakers from outside Yale who want to give a presentation! 

This seminar aims to be a welcoming place for all our attendees. Attendees are always expected to be respectful towards each other and follow the instructions of the discussion leader.
